  When Windows 2000 with SP<4 is detected, this unit reverts the change in
  Delphi 2009 Update 3 that causes VCL apps (even new, empty projects) to
  crash on startup when run on Windows 2000 with no SP/SP1/SP2/sometimes SP3.

  This should be at the top of the .dpr's "uses" clause to ensure it runs
  before any VCL code.

  Details:
  In Delphi 2009 Update 3 (or possibly one of the previous updates),
  TUTF8Encoding.Create in SysUtils was changed to set the
  MB_ERR_INVALID_CHARS flag:

         original: inherited Create(CP_UTF8);
    with Update 3: inherited Create(CP_UTF8, MB_ERR_INVALID_CHARS, 0);

  It appears that when used with CP_UTF8, the MB_ERR_INVALID_CHARS flag is
  only supported beginning with Windows 2000 SP4 and Windows XP. On Windows
  2000 with no SP, MultiByteToWideChar() fails with ERROR_INVALID_FLAGS.

  In Delphi 10.3 Rio this change is still present.

  This code changes TEncoding.UTF8's private FMBToWCharFlags field from
  MB_ERR_INVALID_CHARS back to 0 when Windows 2000 (5.0) with SP<4 is
  detected.

  Note: This won't fix any other instances of TUTF8Encoding, but there
  shouldn't be more than just the one. (Inside the Delphi RTL/VCL,
  TEncoding.GetUTF8 is the only place where TUTF8Encoding.Create is called.)
