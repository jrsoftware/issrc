Compil32.darkstyle.vsf should any VCL Style File with its name changed to Dark using
Bitmap Style Designer (BDS\Bin\BitmapStyleDesigner.exe)

Currently equals VCL Style 'Windows11 Dark 1.0' by Embarcadero from GetIt

For easier testing, you could instead use VCL Style 'Stellar 2.0' by Embarcadero
from GetIt, in either variant. This style features a colored (blue) background with
a white foreground. This combination is very rare, if not unique, among all available
styles. Other styles with a colored background use a black foreground, but since things
are black by default, those are not useful for testing.

Another interesting style to test with is 'Zircon 2.0' by Embarcadero from GetIt. This
style has a textured form background.
